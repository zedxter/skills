name: youtube-search
description: Search YouTube without an API key and get results with publish date, view count, duration, channel and URL, sortable and filterable by date, views, duration and channel. Use when the user asks to find YouTube videos on a topic, the newest or most-watched videos about something, a talk/tutorial/interview/review on YouTube, videos from a particular channel, or needs a video to transcribe or summarise but has no link yet.
license: MIT
compatibility: Python 3.12+ with uv (preferred) or pip; macOS, Linux, Windows. Needs network access to youtube.com. Works from most IPs; the optional --details mode is blocked on cloud/datacenter IPs.

# YouTube Search

Find videos on YouTube from the command line, free and key-less, with the data
you need to judge them: **publish date, view count, duration**, channel and URL.
The script uses `yt-dlp` as a library to call YouTube's own search endpoint.

## When to use

- "Find a video about…", "what are the best/most popular videos on…"
- "Latest videos about…", "anything new this week on…"
- "Is there a talk/tutorial/review of X on YouTube?"
- "Find <channel>'s video about Y"
- The user wants a summary or transcript of a video but has not given a link —
  search first, then hand the chosen URL to the `youtube-transcript` skill.

Not for: video comments, channel statistics, downloading media, or anything
requiring a signed-in account.

## Quick start

The script is `scripts/search.py` relative to this skill. Run with `uv`
(cross-platform; installs `yt-dlp` into a cached environment automatically):

```bash
uv run scripts/search.py python asyncio tutorial
uv run scripts/search.py "LLM agents" --sort date --period month -n 15
uv run scripts/search.py rust borrow checker --sort views --duration long
uv run scripts/search.py asyncio --channel @TechWithTim
```

Without `uv`: `pip install yt-dlp`, then `python scripts/search.py …`.

Default output is a readable list (10 results):

```

```

`~` before a date means approximate (derived from YouTube's "1 year ago");
`--details` replaces it with the exact upload date.

## Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-n, --limit N` | Number of results (default 10, max 100). |
| `--sort relevance\|date\|views\|rating` | Order. `date` = newest first (sorted locally over a larger fetch, see notes). |
| `--period hour\|today\|week\|month\|year` | Only videos uploaded within that window (server-side). |
| `--duration short\|medium\|long` | <4 min / 4–20 min / >20 min (server-side). |
| `--min-minutes F`, `--max-minutes F` | Exact duration bounds (client-side). |
| `--min-views N` | Drop results with fewer views. |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Drop results published before that date. |
| `--type video\|channel\|playlist\|movie` | Result type (default: videos only). |
| `--channel @handle\|URL\|UC…` | Search within one channel. |
| `--details` | One extra request per result: exact upload date, likes, description, available caption languages (manual and auto). |
| `-f table\|json\|urls\|ids` | Output format. `json` carries every field; `urls`/`ids` are for piping into other tools. |
| `--proxy URL` | HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxy if YouTube blocks the IP. |

## How to pick and present results

Always weigh the three numbers the script gives you — do not just take the
first hit:

- **Date.** For fast-moving topics (software versions, AI, news, prices) prefer
  recent uploads: add `--period year` or `--sort date --period month`. For
  timeless topics (maths, history, classic talks) age does not matter; say so.
- **Views.** A proxy for quality and relevance, but biased toward old and
  clickbait videos. Use `--min-views` to cut noise (e.g. 10 000 for mainstream
  topics, 1 000 for niche ones), not as the sole ranking.
- **Duration.** Match the user's need: `--duration short` for a quick answer or
  demo, `long` for a full course/talk/interview. Mention the length when
  recommending, so the user knows what they are committing to.
- **Channel.** Recognisable official or expert channels beat anonymous
  re-uploads with the same title. The `--channel` flag is the fastest way to
  find one creator's video on a subject.

When presenting, give for each recommended video: title, channel, duration,
views, date and the URL — one line per video, in the user's language. Say which
one you would start with and why (newest, most watched, most relevant length).
If the user asks for "the best" video, show 3–5 candidates with those numbers
rather than one.

Use `-f json` when you need to post-process; use `-f urls -n 1` to pipe straight
into the transcript skill. Use `--details` only on a shortlist (≤5): it costs a
request per video, and its `captions_manual`/`captions_auto` fields tell you
whether `youtube-transcript` will succeed before you try.

## Chaining with youtube-transcript

Typical flow for "summarise the latest talk on X":

1. `uv run scripts/search.py X talk --sort date --period year -n 5`
2. Pick one (or ask the user if several are plausible), then run the
   `youtube-transcript` skill's script on its URL.
3. Summarise from the transcript, citing the video's title, channel and date.

## Errors and exit codes

| Exit | Meaning | What to do |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | No results after filters | Loosen `--min-views`, `--after`, `--period`, or broaden the query. |
| 2 | Bad input (empty query, unparsable channel) or `yt-dlp` missing | Fix the argument; or `pip install yt-dlp` / use `uv run`. |
| 4 | Blocked by YouTube (bot check, 429) | Rare for plain search; common for `--details` on cloud IPs. Retry without `--details`, wait a minute, or pass `--proxy`. Don't retry in a tight loop. |
| 6 | Network failure | Check connectivity, retry. |
| 7 | Other yt-dlp error | Usually a YouTube-side change; `uv` fetches the newest `yt-dlp` on a fresh cache, otherwise `pip install -U yt-dlp`. |

With `--details`, a per-video failure does not abort: the result keeps its
basic fields and gains a `details_error` line.

## Notes and limitations

- YouTube's search endpoint ignores sort-by-date, so `--sort date` fetches up
  to 3× `-n` (min 30) results and sorts them locally. Combine with `--period`
  to make "newest" meaningful; without it you get the newest among the most
  relevant, not the newest overall.
- Dates without `--details` are approximate to the granularity YouTube shows
  ("3 weeks ago" → ±a few days, "2 years ago" → ±months).
- Live streams and premieres show `LIVE` instead of a duration and may lack a
  view count.
- Results depend on YouTube's region/language heuristics for the requesting IP.
